		/* yeah, alright, this is kind of messy. but I'd rather have this than have the plugin run a ton of
		simulations every time any hp change happens.  each one of these values represents 10M simulations,
		which is probably overkill, but if I'm calculating them in advance then why not.  so basically this data
		is the result of 6.9 billion (nice) combat simulations of cats/rats fighting to the death.  these simulations
		assume both the cat and rat attack at the same time, and if the cat dies at the same time the rat dies,
		it's a cat death (I don't know what actually happens/if that's even possible).
		source code for the simulations in case you want to double-check it (it's in Python):
		https://pastebin.com/GDr4HDjC
		example of the formatting for these:
		wily cat and rat both have max hp.  wily is 12hp, rat is 15 hp.
		we then pull the value from wily_probability, with wily_probability[cat_hp-1][rat_hp-1]
		so we will get wily_probability[11][14], which is 0.9427.  meaning if I don't feed my cat at all,
		it will survive and win the fight 94.27% of the time if wily cat hp is 12 and rat hp is 15.
